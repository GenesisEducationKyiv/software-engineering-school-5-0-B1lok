# ADR-001: Choosing a database to store user subscriptions

**Status:** Accepted

**Author:** Bilokur Evgen

## Context

In our Go-based weather notification system, we need to persist user subscription data. The database must support data integrity, enforce constraints like composite uniqueness (email + city + frequency), and handle concurrent read/write operations efficiently.

The system is designed using **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles, and we require the database layer to support a clean separation of concerns with a repository pattern. Integration with tools for migrations (specifically golang-migrate) and containerized deployment is also important.

## Considered Options

### 1. PostgreSQL

**Pros:**
- Mature, open-source relational database with strong SQL capabilities.
- Supports ACID transactions and complex relational queries.
- Enum types, composite unique constraints, and foreign keys are natively supported.
- Rich ecosystem and compatibility with Go libraries (`database/sql`, `gorm`).
- Well-suited for containerized deployment (e.g., via Docker Compose).

**Cons:**
- Requires separate service setup and configuration.
- Slightly more complex migration and upgrade process compared to embedded databases.

### 2. MongoDB

**Pros:**
- Flexible, schema-less design â€” easier for rapid prototyping.
- JSON-style document structure feels natural for developers.
- Built-in replication and sharding support for scaling.

**Cons:**
- Not ideal for strict relational data modeling.
- Transactions and joins are less mature than in relational databases.
- Validation and constraints must be handled in application logic.

---

### 3. MySQL

**Pros:**
- Relational database with good performance and ACID compliance.
- Familiar to many developers and supported by many hosting services.
- Lower memory footprint than PostgreSQL in some setups.

**Cons:**
- Less expressive SQL support compared to PostgreSQL.
- Weaker support for enums, custom types, and advanced queries.
- Historically limited with full-text search and window functions.

## Decision

We selected **PostgreSQL** due to its robust relational modeling capabilities, support for SQL constraints, and maturity in production environments. It aligns well with our DDD-based architecture and allows clean implementation of repository-based persistence using Go.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Full support for SQL constraints, enums, and uniqueness validation at the database level.
- High consistency and reliability for transactional operations.
- Strong integration with Go tooling and ORMs.
- Scalable and production-ready for future analytics, reporting, or multi-user features.

### Negative

- Adds complexity in deployment (requires PostgreSQL container/service).
- Slight learning curve for developers unfamiliar with PostgreSQL-specific features.
